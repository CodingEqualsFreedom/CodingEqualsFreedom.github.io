title: Momentum Back
---

Prior Week Goals: None
Progress: None

The project, both development and presentation, went well. This week is the time to get back on the horse and continue with the journey. I've put in a couple of hours in the last two days and hope to fully regain momentum this week. This week's goals are to finish problem set 2 of the MIT online introductory course and read through chapter 5 + watch chapter 5 video.
