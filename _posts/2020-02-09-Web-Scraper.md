title: Web Scraping Tool Project Completed
---
The first targeted project for the year, developing a web scraping tool, has been completed. I built a tool that scrapes economic release data from Trading Economics. It places the economic release data into an excel file so a user can quickly view the upcoming release data for the week. The tool can be found at the following address: [https://github.com/CodingEqualsFreedom/Scraper-EcoReleases]. The next project I will work on is a data analytics and visualization tool.
