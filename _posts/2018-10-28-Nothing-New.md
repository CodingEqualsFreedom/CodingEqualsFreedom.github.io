Prior Week Goals: None
Progress: None

As anticipated, this past week was dominated by work projects. I've spent a significant amount of time coding four new reports that will get presented on Tuesday. Up until that date, my focus has to be on the presentation and tying up loose ends. After Tuesday, the goal is begin the daily investment back into new tech learnings. This presentation should be the last one for the year and there is only one more set of scheduled releases.
