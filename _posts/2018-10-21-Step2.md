Prior Week Goals: Finish Chapter 3 & 4 (Into to Computer Science and Programming
Progress: Completed chapter 3 and invested a little over 6 hours into tech development. Most of those hours went into Tableau

The second week was also one marked by disappointment. The upcoming week is going to be consumed by work projects so I am setting no additional tech goals. After this week, focus will be to really ramp up the time investment.
