title: Step One
---
The first week resulted in myself falling short of expectations. Four hours was spent working with Tableau and another hour was spent going through the Introduction to Computational Programming textbook. I'll really have to step it up in week two. My goal for the week is to finish chapter 3 & 4 + problem sets in Introduction to Computer Science and Programming (MIT Opencourseware 6.00SC) and invest a minimum of two more hours in Tableau. I have an extremely busy work week ahead and projects that need to get wrapped up so total time investment for week two will be set at 10 hours.
