title: Tech Year Journey Begins
---
The journey has begun.......and a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. This is that step. During the next year I will work towards increasing my knowledge and experience in various technologies, emphasizing a focus on programming, data science, and database management. Not only will I invest time into strengthening my current skill sets and practicing new knowledge, I will also invest time into learning new applications that will assist in those endeavors. Each week I will, at a minimum, create one Blog entry to help summarize my time spent and progress made towards that initiative. 

### Technological Intelligence Improvement Goals
1. Python (emphasis on automation, data transformation and manipulation)
2. Tableau + Alteryx (data visualization)
3. Strengthening of SQL/VBA
4. Products: Github, Slack
